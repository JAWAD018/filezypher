const faqs = [
  { q: "Why convert JPG to PNG?", a: "PNG is a lossless format that supports transparency (alpha channel). Use PNG for logos, icons, screenshots, and images where you need a transparent background or pixel-perfect quality. JPG is better for photos where file size matters more than transparency." },
  { q: "Does the conversion reduce image quality?", a: "No. Converting from JPG to PNG is lossless in the sense that the PNG will be an exact pixel-for-pixel copy of the JPG input. Note that JPG compression happens when the original JPG is saved, so some quality may already be lost before you upload." },
  { q: "Will the PNG be larger than the JPG?", a: "Usually yes. PNG uses lossless compression, which tends to produce larger files than JPG's lossy compression. For photos, PNGs can be 2–5× the size of the equivalent JPG." },
  { q: "Is my image uploaded to a server?", a: "Never. The conversion uses the HTML5 Canvas API directly in your browser. Your image data never leaves your device." },
  { q: "Can I convert PNG back to JPG?", a: "Our Image Compressor tool allows you to export images in various formats including JPG. We also plan a dedicated PNG to JPG converter soon." },

          <p>JPEG and PNG serve different purposes. Understanding the difference helps you choose the right format for each project and avoid unnecessarily large files or quality loss.</p>
          <h2>The Key Differences</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Compression:</strong> JPG uses lossy compression (some data is discarded). PNG uses lossless compression (no data lost).</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> PNG supports transparent backgrounds. JPG does not.</li>
            <li><strong>File size:</strong> JPG files are smaller for photographs. PNG files are better for graphics with sharp edges and flat colours.</li>
            <li><strong>Use cases:</strong> Use JPG for photos; use PNG for logos, icons, UI screenshots, and images with text.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Common Use Cases for JPG to PNG Conversion</h2>
          <p>Here are the most common reasons developers and designers convert JPGs to PNG:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Removing a white background from a product photo to place it on a coloured website</li>
            <li>Preserving screenshot quality for documentation or tutorials</li>
            <li>Preparing images for use in presentation slides where white backgrounds would look wrong</li>
            <li>Converting photos for use in graphic design tools that prefer lossless source files</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Privacy: Your Images Stay Private</h2>
          <p>Toolify's JPG to PNG converter uses the HTML5 Canvas API to do all processing directly in your browser. There are zero server requests — your images are never uploaded anywhere. This matters for product photos, personal images, and confidential design assets.</p>
